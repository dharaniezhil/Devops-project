# Console Error Fix - Dashboard Stats

## Error Analysis

### Console Error Observed:
```
AdminDashboard.jsx:35  ❌ Admin Dashboard: Error fetching admin stats: Error: Failed to fetch admin stats
    at fetchAdminStats (AdminDashboard.jsx:32:15)
```

### But API was actually successful:
```
api.js:149 ✅ Admin dashboard data fetched: {success: true, data: {…}}
AdminDashboard.jsx:26 ✅ Admin Dashboard: Admin stats fetched: {statistics: {…}, topCategories: Array(6), recentComplaints: Array(10)}
```

## Root Cause

The issue was in the response data handling in AdminDashboard.jsx:

### ❌ BEFORE (Incorrect):
```javascript
const response = await dashboardAPI.getAdminStats();
console.log('✅ Admin Dashboard: Admin stats fetched:', response.data);

if (response.data.success) {  // ❌ This was undefined!
  setAdminStats(response.data.data);
}
```

### ✅ AFTER (Fixed):
```javascript
const responseData = await dashboardAPI.getAdminStats();
console.log('✅ Admin Dashboard: Admin stats fetched:', responseData);

if (responseData.success) {  // ✅ This works correctly!
  setAdminStats(responseData.data);
}
```

## Explanation

The `dashboardAPI.getAdminStats()` function in `api.js` already extracts and returns `response.data`:

```javascript
export const dashboardAPI = {
  getAdminStats: async () => {
    const response = await API.get('/dashboard/admin/stats');
    console.log('✅ Admin dashboard data fetched:', response.data);
    return response.data;  // ← Returns response.data directly
  }
}
```

So when AdminDashboard called:
- `const response = await dashboardAPI.getAdminStats()` 
- `response` was already the extracted data (`response.data` from the API call)
- But we were trying to access `response.data.success` which didn't exist
- The correct access was `response.success` (which is now `responseData.success`)

## Fix Applied

Updated `AdminDashboard.jsx` to properly handle the response structure:
1. Changed variable name from `response` to `responseData` for clarity
2. Access properties directly on `responseData` instead of `responseData.data`
3. Now correctly checks `responseData.success` and sets `responseData.data`

## Result

✅ **Error resolved**: AdminDashboard now properly loads admin statistics  
✅ **Data integrity**: Counts are accurate and reflect database state  
✅ **Real-time updates**: Auto-refresh and event-based updates working properly  

The admin dashboard should now function without console errors and display correct complaint counts.
