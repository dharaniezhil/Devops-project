# Admin Attendance Page Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Status Display Issue ("Unknown" statuses)
**Problem**: Admin attendance page was showing "Unknown" status instead of proper statuses like "Check-in" or "Check-out".
**Root Cause**: Frontend `getStatusBadge` function was checking for `checked_in` and `checked_out` but backend was returning `check_in` and `check_out`.
**Fix**: Updated status mapping in `getStatusBadge` function to match backend values:
- `check_in` and `on_duty` → "On Duty" (green)
- `check_out` → "Off Duty" (yellow)
- `break` → "On Break" (blue)  
- `overtime` → "Overtime" (pink)
- `leave` → "On Leave" (red) - newly added

### 2. Search and Filter Functionality
**Problem**: Search and filter inputs weren't triggering API calls when changed.
**Fix**: Added debounced useEffect hook that watches for changes in:
- `filters.labourName` (search input)
- `filters.date` (date filter)
- `filters.status` (status filter)
Uses 500ms debounce to prevent excessive API calls.

### 3. Status Filter Options
**Problem**: Filter dropdown used incorrect values (`checked_in`, `checked_out`) that didn't match backend expectations.
**Fix**: Updated filter options to match backend values:
- `check_in` → "Checked In"
- `check_out` → "Checked Out"
- `break` → "On Break"
- `overtime` → "Overtime"
- `leave` → "On Leave" (newly added)

### 4. Edit Modal Missing Leave Option
**Problem**: Edit attendance modal dropdown was missing the 'leave' option.
**Fix**: Added `<option value="leave">Leave</option>` to the edit modal dropdown.

## Code Changes Made

### File: `frontend/src/pages/admin/ManageAttendance/ManageAttendance.jsx`

1. **Updated getStatusBadge function** (lines 124-136):
   - Changed `checked_in` to `check_in`
   - Changed `checked_out` to `check_out`
   - Added `on_duty` case (maps to "On Duty")
   - Added `leave` case with red styling

2. **Updated status filter options** (lines 316-321):
   - Changed filter values to match backend expectations
   - Added leave option

3. **Added search/filter trigger** (lines 163-171):
   - New useEffect with 500ms debounce
   - Watches labourName, date, and status filters
   - Only triggers when on 'allAttendance' tab

4. **Updated edit modal dropdown** (line 567):
   - Added leave option to edit modal

## Expected Results

After these fixes:
- ✅ Admin attendance page should show correct statuses instead of "Unknown"
- ✅ Search by labour name should work with 500ms debounce
- ✅ Date filtering should work properly
- ✅ Status filtering should work with correct backend values
- ✅ Edit modal should include all attendance types including leave
- ✅ Leave status should display with red "On Leave" badge

## API Endpoints Working With

- `GET /api/admin/attendance/on-duty` - Currently on duty labours
- `GET /api/admin/attendance` - All attendance records with filtering
- `GET /api/admin/attendance/labour-status` - All labours with status
- `PUT /api/admin/attendance/:id` - Update attendance record
- `DELETE /api/admin/attendance/:id` - Delete attendance record

## Notes

- Frontend expects `attendance.labour.name` for labour name display
- Frontend expects `attendance.type` for status/action type
- Backend properly populates labour information via mongoose populate
- All CRUD operations should work correctly with the fixes
