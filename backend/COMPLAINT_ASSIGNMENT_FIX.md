# Complaint Assignment Error Fix

## Problem Description

The backend was throwing a validation error when trying to assign complaints to labours:

```
Error: Complaint validation failed: status: Assigned is not a valid status. Only Pending, In Progress, and Resolved are allowed
```

This error occurred in two places:
1. `PUT /api/complaints/:id/assign` (main complaints route)
2. `PUT /api/admin/complaints/:id/assign` (admin complaints route)

## Root Cause

The Complaint model's status enum only included these values:
```javascript
values: ['Pending', 'In Progress', 'Resolved']
```

However, the assignment logic in both routes was trying to set:
```javascript
complaint.status = 'Assigned';
```

This caused a Mongoose validation error because 'Assigned' was not in the allowed enum values.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated Complaint Model Status Enum

**File**: `src/models/Complaint.js`

**Before** (line 61):
```javascript
values: ['Pending', 'In Progress', 'Resolved'],
message: '{VALUE} is not a valid status. Only Pending, In Progress, and Resolved are allowed'
```

**After** (line 61):
```javascript
values: ['Pending', 'Assigned', 'In Progress', 'Resolved'],
message: '{VALUE} is not a valid status. Only Pending, Assigned, In Progress, and Resolved are allowed'
```

### 2. Fixed Complaint Statistics Route

**File**: `src/routes/complaints.js`

The stats endpoint was trying to count complaints with invalid status values like 'Completed' and 'Rejected' which don't exist in our enum.

**Before** (lines 282-288):
```javascript
const total = await Complaint.countDocuments();
const pending = await Complaint.countDocuments({ status: 'Pending' });
const assigned = await Complaint.countDocuments({ status: 'Assigned' });
const inProgress = await Complaint.countDocuments({ status: 'In Progress' });
const completed = await Complaint.countDocuments({ status: 'Completed' }); // ❌ Invalid
const resolved = await Complaint.countDocuments({ status: 'Resolved' });
const rejected = await Complaint.countDocuments({ status: 'Rejected' }); // ❌ Invalid
```

**After** (lines 282-286):
```javascript
const total = await Complaint.countDocuments();
const pending = await Complaint.countDocuments({ status: 'Pending' });
const assigned = await Complaint.countDocuments({ status: 'Assigned' });
const inProgress = await Complaint.countDocuments({ status: 'In Progress' });
const resolved = await Complaint.countDocuments({ status: 'Resolved' });
```

**Also updated the response object** to remove the invalid fields:
```javascript
res.json({ 
  success: true, 
  stats: { 
    total, 
    pending, 
    assigned, 
    inProgress, 
    resolved, 
    byCategory, 
    recent 
  } 
});
```

## Verification

Created and ran a test script (`test-complaint-status.js`) that confirmed:

✅ **'Assigned' status is now valid**
```
✅ "Assigned" status is valid
```

✅ **All valid statuses work correctly**
```
✅ "Pending" status is valid
✅ "Assigned" status is valid
✅ "In Progress" status is valid  
✅ "Resolved" status is valid
```

✅ **Invalid statuses still fail validation**
```
✅ Invalid status correctly failed validation
```

✅ **Static methods work correctly**
```
✅ getActiveTaskCount method works. Found 0 active tasks for test labour
```

## Impact

### ✅ Fixed Routes
- `PUT /api/complaints/:id/assign` - Now works without validation errors
- `PUT /api/admin/complaints/:id/assign` - Now works without validation errors
- `GET /api/complaints/stats/overview` - Now returns correct statistics

### ✅ Preserved Functionality
- The `getActiveTaskCount` static method already included 'Assigned' status in its query
- Task assignment limits (4 tasks per labour) continue to work correctly
- Leave status checking continues to work correctly
- All existing workflow remains intact

## Status Flow

The complaint status flow is now:
1. **Pending** → Initial state when complaint is created
2. **Assigned** → When admin assigns the complaint to a labour  
3. **In Progress** → When labour starts working on the complaint
4. **Resolved** → When the work is completed

## Frontend Impact

The frontend should now receive successful responses when assigning complaints instead of 500 Internal Server Errors. The assignment functionality in both the main complaint interface and admin dashboard should work properly.

## Notes

- No database migration is required as existing documents will continue to work
- New complaints can now use the 'Assigned' status without validation errors
- The status enum is now properly aligned with the application's workflow requirements
